# Brent Oil Prices Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Brent oil prices and understanding how political and economic events affect these prices. The goal is to develop a robust time series analysis model to forecast Brent oil prices while considering external influences such as geopolitical events, economic indicators, and market sentiment.

## Task 1: Defining the Data Analysis Workflow and Understanding the Model and Data

### Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Collect historical Brent oil price data from trusted financial databases or APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Quandl).
   - Include economic and political event data that could influence oil prices, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure that the data is consistent and prepared for analysis.
   - Normalize or standardize the data as needed to make it suitable for modeling.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and any irregular patterns in the data.
   - Investigate relationships between Brent oil prices and external factors such as economic events.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features based on economic and political data, such as oil production rates, consumption, and geopolitical stability indices.
   - Perform lagging and rolling window transformations to capture time dependencies.

5. **Model Selection**
   - Choose suitable time series models like ARIMA or GARCH to forecast future prices.
   - Understand the input parameters, including historical prices, and external factors like market demand, geopolitical events, and economic indicators.

6. **Model Training**
   - Train the selected model on the historical data, ensuring proper hyperparameter tuning.
   - Use cross-validation to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and out-of-sample validation.

8. **Forecasting**
   - Use the trained model to forecast future Brent oil prices and quantify uncertainty.

9. **Results Communication**
   - Present the results in easily interpretable formats such as reports, dashboards, and visualizations.

### Key Concepts and Models

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
  - ARIMA is a popular time series model that combines autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I) to make data stationary, and moving average (MA) terms to model price fluctuations over time.
  - ARIMA is used to forecast future values of time series data based on its past values.

- **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**
  - GARCH is used to model the volatility (variance) of time series data. It captures changes in the variance of a time series over time, which is useful when analyzing oil price fluctuations and uncertainty.
  
### Data Generation and Modeling Process

- **Data Generation**: The data is generated through market transactions, geopolitical events, and economic factors. It is important to understand how these variables interact with oil price fluctuations.
  
- **Modeling the Data**: The ARIMA and GARCH models are used to capture time-dependent trends and volatility in the data. These models will help predict future prices based on historical patterns and volatility behavior.

### Assumptions and Limitations

- **Assumptions**:
  - Historical price patterns will continue under similar market conditions.
  - External economic and political events will have predictable effects on Brent oil prices.
  
- **Limitations**:
  - Data quality may impact model accuracy, especially if external factors (such as sudden geopolitical events) are not accurately captured.
  - Models like ARIMA and GARCH assume that past data will repeat itself and might not account for rare or unprecedented events.

### Communication of Results

- **Main Media Channels**:
  - **Reports**: Detailed written analysis of findings, including charts and graphs.
  - **Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations to present forecasts and insights.
  - **Presentations**: PowerPoint slides summarizing key findings for stakeholder meetings.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
  - Statsmodels (for ARIMA modeling)
  - Arch (for GARCH modeling)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Expected Outputs

- Forecasted Brent oil prices for the next [X] weeks/months.
- Insights into the relationship between external factors (economic/political events) and oil prices.
- Uncertainty estimates (confidence intervals) for the forecasts.
